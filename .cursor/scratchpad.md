# Somni Project Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Feature 1.1: Project & Development Environment Setup** ✅ COMPLETED

**Feature 1.2: User Authentication & Profile** ✅ COMPLETED

**Feature 2.1: New User Onboarding Flow** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

Goal: Create a complete multi-step onboarding flow that collects user preferences and persists them to Supabase. This includes sleep schedule, dream goals, lucidity experience, and privacy settings.

This includes:

1. Installing lottie-react-native for animations ✅
2. Updating authStore to include user profile management ✅
3. Updating useAuth hook to fetch user profiles ✅
4. Creating OnboardingNavigator and reusable components ✅
5. Building complete onboarding flow with data collection ✅
6. Implementing Supabase data persistence ✅
7. Updating AppNavigator to conditionally show onboarding ✅

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to ensure proper workspace configuration for monorepo structure
- Modern Husky v9+ requires manual file creation rather than deprecated automatic setup
- Reactotron integration needs custom Zustand monitor to avoid deprecated third-party packages
- Development builds are essential for future native module integrations

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] **Step 1**: Install expo-dev-client in mobile workspace
- [x] **Step 2**: Create and configure eas.json with development, preview, and production profiles
- [x] **Step 3**: Setup Git hooks with Husky using modern syntax and pre-commit linting
- [x] **Step 4**: Setup Reactotron with custom Zustand monitor for debugging

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**LATEST UPDATE - Duplicate Types Workspace Issue Resolution:**

✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE FULLY RESOLVED** - Fixed duplicate `@somni/types` workspace causing npm install failures

#### Issue Description:

- Two `@somni/types` packages existed: one in `types/` and one in `packages/types/`
- Workspace configuration included both locations, causing "must not have multiple workspaces with the same name" error
- TypeScript path mapping pointed to old `types/src` location
- Multiple package.json files referenced incorrect paths
- Secondary "Invalid Version" error occurred due to cached references to removed directory

#### Resolution Steps Completed:

1. **Content Consolidation** ✅

   - Merged all types from `types/src/index.ts` into `packages/types/src/index.ts`
   - Added missing types: `SleepPhase`, `DreamEntity`, `User`, `DreamEntry`
   - Enhanced `UserProfile` interface with backward compatibility fields
   - Maintained all existing type exports to prevent breaking changes

2. **Configuration Updates** ✅

   - Updated `tsconfig.base.json` path mapping: `"@somni/types": ["packages/types/src"]`
   - Removed `types` from workspace array in root `package.json`
   - Updated all package.json dependencies to point to correct paths:
     - `apps/mobile/package.json`: `"@somni/types": "file:../../packages/types"`
     - `packages/core/package.json`: `"@somni/types": "file:../types"`
     - `packages/stores/package.json`: `"@somni/types": "file:../types"`
     - `utils/package.json`: `"@somni/types": "file:../packages/types"`

3. **Cleanup & Cache Resolution** ✅

   - Removed old `types/` directory completely
   - Performed complete cleanup of all `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` files
   - Fresh npm install completed successfully without any errors

4. **Verification** ✅
   - TypeScript compilation works in all packages
   - All 11 existing `@somni/types` imports resolve correctly
   - No duplicate workspace errors
   - No "Invalid Version" errors
   - Package structure properly recognized
   - npm ls shows clean dependency tree

#### Files Modified:

- `packages/types/src/index.ts` - Consolidated all type definitions
- `tsconfig.base.json` - Updated path mapping
- `package.json` - Removed duplicate workspace entry
- `apps/mobile/package.json` - Fixed dependency path
- `packages/core/package.json` - Fixed dependency path
- `packages/stores/package.json` - Fixed dependency path
- `utils/package.json` - Fixed dependency path

#### Final Verification Results:

```bash
$ npm ls @somni/types
somni-monorepo@1.0.0
├─┬ @somni/core@1.0.0 -> ./packages/core
│ └── @somni/types@1.0.0 deduped -> ./packages/types
├─┬ @somni/mobile@1.0.0 -> ./apps/mobile
│ └── @somni/types@1.0.0 deduped -> ./packages/types
├─┬ @somni/stores@1.0.0 -> ./packages/stores
│ └── @somni/types@1.0.0 deduped -> ./packages/types
├── @somni/types@1.0.0 -> ./packages/types
└─┬ @somni/utils@0.1.0 -> ./utils
  └── @somni/types@1.0.0 deduped -> ./packages/types
```

#### Impact:

- ✅ npm install works flawlessly without any errors
- ✅ All TypeScript imports resolve correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ Monorepo workspace structure is clean and consistent
- ✅ Development environment fully functional
- ✅ All caching issues resolved

- Ask before using -force git commands

# Somni App - Complete Design Overhaul

## Background and Motivation

User requested comprehensive design fixes for their React Native Expo dream journaling app "Somni" with completed Features 1.1 (dev environment), 1.2 (authentication), and 2.1 (onboarding flow). The main issues identified were:

1. **Welcome screen showing translation keys** instead of actual text
2. **Basic purple/gray theme** not feeling dreamlike enough
3. **Button height inconsistencies** throughout the app
4. **Missing reusable Input component** causing styling inconsistencies
5. **Mixed styling concerns** with inline styles in components

User specifically requested to **remove light mode entirely** and create an "oniric" (dreamlike) design optimized for nighttime dream journaling, ensure all components are reusable, implement proper translations, and follow strict best practices.
