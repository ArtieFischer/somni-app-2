# Onboarding Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Bar Breaking (Going to 0 from Sleep Rhythm Screen)
- Fixed the `StepIndicator` component to properly handle dynamic steps
- Added validation to ensure currentStep is always within valid range
- Modified `ProfileOnboardingScreen` to use a fixed total steps count (5 main steps)
- Created proper step mapping to handle conditional steps (sleep schedule and lucid experience are part of "Goals" step)

### 2. Sleep Rhythm Picker Full Hour Range (0-23)
- Set default times to sensible values (10 PM for bedtime, 7 AM for wake time)
- Added a "Done" button for iOS time picker
- Improved picker container styling with shadow effects
- Set 5-minute intervals for better UX

### 3. Sleep Rhythm Picker Display Issues
- Enhanced the picker container styling with elevation and shadows
- Fixed the iOS time picker to stay open until user taps "Done"
- Improved visual feedback and user interaction

### 4. Consistent Back Buttons Across Steps
- Updated `BackButton` component to support icon and different variants
- Applied BackButton consistently across all onboarding steps:
  - StepPersonalInfo
  - StepDreamInterpreter
  - StepPreferences
  - StepSleepSchedule
  - StepLucidExperience
  - StepLocation
  - StepReview
- All back buttons now have the same styling and behavior

### 5. Location Step Progress Indicator
- Fixed the step mapping in `getCurrentStepNumber()` to properly show "Location" in the progress indicator
- Added proper translation keys for the location step

### 6. Manual Location Entry with Dropdowns
- Replaced free text input with country and city dropdown selects
- Added sample data for countries and major cities
- Implemented dynamic city loading based on selected country
- Used the existing `Select` component from Gluestack UI
