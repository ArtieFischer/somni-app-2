# Toast Notifications & UX Improvements Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Toast Notifications Instead of Alerts
- Created `useDreamNotifications` hook to centralize all dream-related notifications
- Replaced all Alert.alert calls with toast notifications
- Added duplicate prevention (5-second threshold)
- Toast notifications for:
  - Recording started
  - Transcription started
  - Transcription complete (with "View" action)
  - Transcription failed (with "Retry" action)
  - Offline mode

### 2. Fixed Multiple Notifications
- Only show transcription complete notification on the focused screen
- DreamDiaryScreen checks if it's focused before showing notifications
- RecordScreen handles its own notifications
- Centralized notification logic prevents duplicates

### 3. Smooth Progress Bars
- Created `AnimatedProgress` component for smooth progress animation
- Progress animates from 0% to 90% over 9 seconds during transcription
- Jumps to 100% when complete
- Visual feedback during the transcription process

### 4. Improved Flow After "Transcribe Now"
- No longer blocks user on the recording screen
- Shows "Processing Dream" toast notification
- Automatically navigates to Dream Diary after 500ms
- User can see their dream being processed in real-time
- Offline mode: saves locally and navigates to diary
