# Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Progress Bar Now Reaches 95%
**File:** `/apps/mobile/src/components/molecules/DreamCard/DreamCard.tsx`
- Changed calculation from `elapsed / 100` to `(elapsed / 10000) * 95`
- Progress bar now smoothly animates to 95% over 10 seconds
- Previously was only reaching ~50% due to incorrect math

### 2. âœ… Preventing Duplicate Notifications
**Files Modified:**
- `/apps/mobile/src/screens/main/RecordScreen/RecordScreen.tsx`
  - Added `recordedDreamIdsRef` to track dreams created from this screen
  - Only shows notifications for dreams that were recorded from RecordScreen
  - Removes dream ID from tracking after showing notification

- `/apps/mobile/src/hooks/useRecordingHandler.ts`
  - Modified `acceptRecording` to return the created dream ID
  - Returns `string | null` to allow tracking

- RecordScreen already tracks dream IDs when accepted:
  ```typescript
  onAccept={async () => {
    const dreamId = await acceptRecording();
    if (dreamId) {
      recordedDreamIdsRef.current.add(dreamId);
    }
  }}
  ```

### 3. âœ… Fixed Empty Toast Notifications
**Files Modified:**
- `/apps/mobile/src/components/atoms/Toast/Toast.tsx`
  - Fixed missing `AlertTriangleIcon` import issue
  - Changed warning icon to use `InfoIcon` instead

- `/apps/mobile/src/hooks/useDreamNotifications.ts`
  - Added fallback text in case translations fail
  - Added debug logging to track toast content
  - Ensures title and description are never empty

### 4. âœ… Text Shows "Transcribing..." Correctly
- This was already fixed - shows "Transcribing your dream..." when status is 'transcribing'

## How It Works Now

1. **Recording Flow:**
   - User records and accepts â†’ Dream ID is tracked
   - Only RecordScreen shows notification for that specific dream
   - DreamDiaryScreen only shows notifications when focused

2. **Progress Bar:**
   - Smoothly animates from 0% to 95% over 10 seconds
   - Jumps to 100% when transcription completes
   - More realistic progress indication

3. **Notifications:**
   - No duplicate notifications - each screen only shows relevant ones
   - Toast notifications have fallback text to prevent empty messages
   - Debug logging helps track notification content

## Debugging Tips
If you still see empty notifications, check the console for:
```
ðŸ”” Showing transcription complete toast: { dreamId, title, description }
```

This will show what text is being passed to the toast system.
