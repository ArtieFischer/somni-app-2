I could see my childhood home below, but it looked different - bigger and more magical. As I flew closer, I realized I could control the wind with my thoughts. The feeling of freedom was indescribable. I woke up feeling inspired and energized.`,

I could understand their language - they were telling stories about ancient oceans. The water was warm and comforting, like being wrapped in liquid starlight.`,

When the wind blew, you could hear whispers of all the tales being told at once. I climbed one of the trees and found myself in a library in the clouds. The librarian was an owl who gave me a book about my future.`,
