## New Features Deep Dive

### Progressive Upload System

The upload system provides enterprise-grade reliability with intelligent adaptation to network conditions:

#### Key Features:
- **Chunked Uploads**: Large files are split into manageable chunks for reliable transmission
- **Network Awareness**: Automatically adjusts upload strategy based on connection quality
- **Offline Queue**: Recordings are queued when offline and uploaded when connectivity returns
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry limits
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with speed and time estimates
- **Completion Feedback**: Visual success notifications with animated toasts

#### Network Adaptation:
- **Excellent WiFi**: Large chunks (5MB), 3 concurrent uploads
- **Good Connection**: Standard chunks (1MB), 2 concurrent uploads  
- **Fair Connection**: Small chunks (512KB), single upload
- **Poor Connection**: Minimal chunks (256KB), extended timeouts

#### Usage Example:
```typescript
const queueHook = useOfflineRecordingQueue();

// Add recording to queue
queueHook.addRecording({
  sessionId: 'session_123',
  audioUri: 'file://recording.wav',
  duration: 120,
  fileSize: 2048000,
  recordedAt: new Date().toISOString()
});

// Monitor upload progress
const { currentUpload, networkStatus } = queueHook;
if (currentUpload) {
  console.log(`Upload progress: ${currentUpload.progress.percentage}%`);
}
```

### Enhanced Recording Experience

A completely redesigned recording flow optimized for immediate responsiveness:

#### Key Improvements:
- **Instant UI Feedback**: Recording button and timer respond immediately to user interaction
- **Background Audio Setup**: Audio permissions and initialization happen asynchronously
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Clean UI state management if audio setup fails
- **Real-time Progress**: Duration timer starts instantly for better user perception
- **Visual Upload Feedback**: Live progress bars with completion notifications

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
const startRecording = useCallback(async () => {
  // Update UI state immediately for instant feedback
  dreamStore.startRecording();
  setRecordingDuration(0);

  // Start duration timer immediately
  durationTimerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
    setRecordingDuration(prev => prev + 1);
  }, 1000);

  // Audio setup happens in background
  audioService.startRecording().catch(handleError);
}, []);
```

### Complete Mobile Application

#### Screen Features:
- **Record Screen**: Enhanced with instant feedback, upload progress, and queue status
- **Dream Diary**: Advanced search, filtering, tagging, and statistical insights
- **Feed Screen**: Preview of upcoming community features with detailed descriptions
- **Analysis Screen**: Current analytics with preview of advanced AI-powered insights
- **Profile Screen**: Complete user management with preferences, stats, and settings

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Smart Search**: Real-time dream search with confidence scoring and tag filtering
- **Visual Statistics**: Dream count, recording time, confidence averages, and peak hours
- **Preference Management**: Theme, language, notifications, and recording settings
- **Upload Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into upload queue with retry capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user-friendly messaging

### Comprehensive Internationalization

A complete i18n system supporting multiple languages and regions:

#### Implementation Features:

- **Type-Safe Translations**: Full TypeScript support for translation keys
- **React Native Compatibility**: Proper String() casting for all translations
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized translation usage across all components
- **Future-Ready**: Easy addition of new languages through JSON files

#### Translation Organization:
```typescript
// Organized by domain
const { t } = useTranslation('dreams'); // For recording features
const { t } = useTranslation('auth');   // For authentication
const { t } = useTranslation('common'); // For shared UI elements

// Usage with React Native compatibility
<Text>{String(t('record.title'))}</Text>
```

### Oniric Design System

A dreamlike design system optimized for nighttime use:

#### Design Principles:
- **Dark-First**: Optimized for low-light environments
