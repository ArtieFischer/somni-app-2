# Project Overview

## Purpose and Vision

Somni is a comprehensive dream tracking and analysis application that transforms the deeply personal experience of dreaming into actionable insights. By combining voice-first recording, advanced AI interpretation, and social discovery features, Somni helps users understand their subconscious patterns, achieve lucid dreaming, and connect with a global community of dreamers.

The app addresses the universal human need to understand and remember dreams, which typically fade within minutes of waking, while providing scientific tools for sleep improvement and psychological self-discovery.

## Architecture Principles

### âœ… Implemented Clean Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer** (`apps/mobile/src/components`, `apps/mobile/src/screens`): UI components organized as atoms, molecules, and organisms
- **State Management Layer** (`packages/stores`): Zustand stores for auth, onboarding, and application state
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`apps/mobile/src/infrastructure`): Supabase service implementations and external service wrappers
- **Shared Concerns**: Theme system, localization, and utilities as separate packages

### âœ… Implemented Design System

- **Atomic Design**: Components organized as atoms (Button, Input), molecules (MultiSelectChip), and organisms (OnboardingScreenLayout)
- **Oniric Theme System**: Comprehensive design tokens for aurora colors, midnight spacing, ethereal typography, and purple shadows
- **Dark-Only Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for nighttime use with consistent spacing patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant contrast ratios, 48dp minimum button heights, and semantic markup

### âœ… Implemented State Management Strategy

- **Zustand Stores**: Lightweight, performant state management with TypeScript support
- **Domain-Driven State**: Stores organized by business domains (auth with profiles, onboarding data collection)
- **Persistence**: Auth state persistence with automatic restoration on app launch
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with background Supabase synchronization
