# UX Fixes Summary

## All 5 Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. ✅ Removed automatic navigation to Dream Diary
- **File:** `/apps/mobile/src/hooks/useRecordingHandler.ts`
- After clicking "Transcribe now", the app stays on the record screen
- Removed all navigation calls to Dream Diary
- Also removed unused navigation imports and dependencies

### 2. ✅ No automatic routing after transcription finishes
- The app stays on the current screen when transcription completes
- Users can manually navigate to Dream Diary if they want to see their dreams

### 3. ✅ Removed "Recording Started" toast notification
- **File:** `/apps/mobile/src/screens/main/RecordScreen/RecordScreen.tsx`
- The `showRecordingStarted()` call was already removed
- No toast appears when recording starts - users see the UI feedback instead

### 4. ✅ Fixed empty text in transcription complete notification
- Added a 100ms delay before showing the notification to ensure toast system is ready
- Notification should now properly show:
  - Title: "Dream Transcribed"
  - Message: "Your dream has been successfully transcribed"

### 5. ✅ Fixed progress bar and "Transcribing..." text
- **File:** `/apps/mobile/src/components/molecules/DreamCard/DreamCard.tsx`
- Progress bar now animates to 95% (instead of 90%)
- Text shows "Transcribing your dream..." when status is 'transcribing'
- Text shows "Waiting for transcription..." only when status is 'pending'

## Current UX Flow

1. **Start Recording**: 
   - Tap record button
   - No toast notification
   - See recording UI

2. **Stop Recording**:

   - See "Accept/Cancel" options

3. **Transcribe Now**:
   - Click "Transcribe now"
   - See "Processing Dream" toast
   - Stay on record screen (ready for next recording)

4. **In Dream Diary**:
   - See dream with progress bar animating to 95%
   - See "Transcribing your dream..." text
   - When complete: progress bar disappears, transcript appears

5. **Transcription Complete**:
   - "Dream Transcribed" toast appears (with proper text)
   - Can click "View" to see the dream
   - No automatic navigation

## Benefits
